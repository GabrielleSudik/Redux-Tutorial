So what does "npm install" do? 
It installs whatever packages are listed in the package.json dependencies script.
Make you run the command from whatever folder that package is in.

This lesson:
"npm install webpack --save-dev"
That command installs webpack package, and puts it in the package.json file
the --save-dev part puts it in the devDependencies, so it's only used during development.

And 
"npm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev"
That will host the application.

Webpack needs loaders. They give instructions to webpack about how to read the code. Like tranlating ES6 to JS.
"npm install babel-loader --save-dev"
"npm install json-loader --save-dev"
"npm install babel-core --save-dev"

These are now all listed in DevDependencies in the package.json

We want the index.js appReducer to run in a browser window. It currently has several imports.
Webpack will bundle all of its imports into one bundle.
We create a file with the instructions to webpack how to do that:
webpack.config.js

Finally, replace the package scripts with:
"start": "./node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server"

Open browser, go to
localhost:3000
F12 and check the console. You'll see index.js's stuff logged there.

(Note to self: something isn't working in your setup, don't worry about it, future lessons will correct the code.)
