To get your project working, you need node.js.
And WE need Babel for this project as well.

In the console, in your project's /start folder, 
"node version" or "node -v" to confirm you have node.
(This varies depending on which computer you use for some reason.)
"npm init" -- will create a package.json file
You can just accept defaults or enter info.
Note it created in your finished/src for some reason.
"npm install babel-cli babel-core --save-dev"
"npm install babel-preset-latest --save-dev"
"npm install babel-preset-stage-0 --save-dev" (experimental features)
"npm install babel-preset-env --save-dev" (try this instead of the preceeding three? npm install recommends it. or maybe that's instead of npm install only?)
"npm install" -- needed sometimes, I think the prof lets you know when.
"npm install redux --save" (was not used through 02-06!)

.babelrc (created by you) stores which babel features you'll be using.

In package.json, there is a "scripts" that defaulted to "test".
Change it to "start" then the paths of node and the app. (go there to see them)

**NOTE** you might need to Show All Files after you install stuff.
Not everything showed up after creation.

To run the app: "npm start"

In future folders, you need "npm init" and at least the first "npm install babel" line. before you "npm start".
