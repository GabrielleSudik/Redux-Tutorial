Until this lesson, we hadn't actually used redux.
Everything so far were just JS functions. (I guess action and payload are not redux specific then).
"npm install redux --save"

Combining reducers: Allow sending of entire state to a single reducer.
The reducer must have the same organization as the entire state (outlined in initialState.js).

"npm start" (remember, from package.json scripts line)
