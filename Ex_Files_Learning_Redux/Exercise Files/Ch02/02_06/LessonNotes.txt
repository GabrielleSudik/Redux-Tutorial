constants.js, initialState.js and the challenges folder

need to run "npm install" for this lesson 

"npm run challenge-a" -b, -c, -d
where did he get those names???
package.json -- scripts (he created these ahead of the lesson.
	They are kind of like aliases, they'll run whatever is written after each item.)

This challenge is set up by comparing actuals to expected for the four constants.
Write reducers to make each pass the test.
