Redux is a functional language. So don't think of nouns, like OOP.
Think in terms of verbs. What will the app and the user do?
Stuff like: add calendar events, fetch resort names, set goals, and cancelling stuff too.

Start with constants.js in start/src.
You'll add the constants for all of the verbs that will be in the app.

Nouns have a place, usually in the State. Eg, what is the thing and what is it at any given moment?
Those will be in initialState.json. That is the snapshot of the state.

The actions/verbs and the state are the two major parts of a redux app.
Next up: "Reducers" which manage the verbs and the state.
